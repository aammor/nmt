# translation_machine
repository for training and testing of multiple model for neural machine translation, on various dataset for translation from french to english (with a double purpose, ,doing a benchmark on nmt models, and testing the framework 'ploomber', how ) . 

For the moment, a "transformer" model is tested, on a single dataset, (that could be truncated to smaller dataset for experiemtations), other models (recents and old) will be added later.
